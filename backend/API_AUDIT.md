# AgriFlow API — Test & Standards Audit

**Date:** 2026-09-23
**Scope:** Full functional pass against all 14 endpoints, plus an
adversarial/standards pass (SQL injection, XSS-shaped input, malformed auth,
oversized payloads, a 500-request ID-collision stress test, Content-Type
handling, CORS preflight).
**Method:** Tested locally against a fresh migrated database; also
spot-checked against the live Railway deployment.

---

## Result summary

**Functional: pass.** Auth, role gating, listing ownership, stock
validation, and — most importantly — the transaction state machine (illegal
transitions, wrong-actor transitions, terminal-state lockout, unknown status
strings) all behave exactly as coded, with correct HTTP status codes and
accurate error messages. SQL injection is **not exploitable** — parameterized
queries throughout; a `'; DROP TABLE users;--'` payload was stored as inert
text and the `users` table was confirmed intact afterward. Password hashing
is Argon2, correctly implemented.

The rest of this document is everything that is **not** standard and should
be treated as a punch list.

## Required changes (blocking)

### 1. Four endpoints require no authentication at all — ✅ FIXED (2026-09-24)
`GET /listings`, `GET /listings/{id}`, `GET /demands`, `GET /demands/{id}`.
Flagged as undesirable for this product. Fixed by adding the `auth:
AuthUser` extractor to all four handlers — any authenticated role (buyer,
supplier, logistics, admin) can now browse, but an anonymous caller gets
`401 Missing Authorization header.`. No role restriction beyond "must be
logged in," since both buyers and suppliers legitimately need to browse
both listings and demands. Verified: unauthenticated requests to all four
routes now 401; authenticated requests (any role) succeed unchanged.
See the updated API surface table in `README.md`.

A resource-key-based gate (a secret issued by the backend, separate from
user login) was considered and deliberately rejected in favor of this
simpler fix — see discussion history for the reasoning: a statically
embedded key in a public SPA build is trivially extractable from the
browser bundle regardless of expiry, and a dynamically-issued key with no
credential check on issuance doesn't stop scripted abuse either. User-role
gating was judged sufficient for now.

### 2. Decimal fields serialize as JSON strings, not numbers — ✅ FIXED (2026-09-24)
`quantity`, `pricePerUnit`, `totalAmount`, and `indicativeBudget` all came
back as `"20"` instead of `20` (a `rust_decimal::Decimal` default). Fixed
by enabling the `serde-with-float` feature on `rust_decimal` and annotating
every response-facing `Decimal` field (`SupplyListing`, `DemandRequest`,
`Transaction`) with `#[serde(with = "rust_decimal::serde::float")]`. Only
the *response* side was changed — request DTOs (`CreateListingRequest`,
`CreateDemandRequest`, `CreateTransactionRequest`, `UpdateListingRequest`)
were left on the default (flexible) `Decimal` deserializer, since they
already accepted numbers correctly and nothing needed fixing there.
Verified: `GET /listings`, `/demands`, `/transactions` now return unquoted
JSON numbers; `POST /listings` still accepts and round-trips correctly.
The frontend's `apiMappers.ts` coercion (`num()`) is unaffected — it
already tolerates receiving real numbers instead of strings.

### 3. The trade lifecycle dead-ends at `PAYMENT_PENDING`
Confirmed structurally, not just by the "not built yet" note in
`README.md`: `PAYMENT_CONFIRMED` only accepts the `system` actor in
`src/state_machine.rs`, and no endpoint can authenticate as `system`. No
client — not even admin — can move a transaction past payment-pending
today. Nothing downstream (logistics, delivery, completion) is reachable
until a payment/webhook endpoint exists.

### 4. Entity ID generation has an unhandled collision window — ✅ FIXED (2026-09-24)
`src/ids.rs::generate()` draws a random 5-digit suffix (`10_000..99_999`,
~90,000 values) with no collision check or retry, and that value is the
literal `TEXT PRIMARY KEY` for users, listings, demands, and transactions.
By the birthday paradox, ~375 inserts of one entity type give roughly 50%
odds of a collision, which would surface as a raw, unhandled `500 A
database error occurred.`

Fixed with a retry loop (not a switch to UUIDs — `README.md` explicitly
documents the human-readable id format as intentional, and a retry loop
preserves it without that larger, more disruptive change). Added
`ids::MAX_ID_ATTEMPTS` (5) and `ids::is_id_collision(&sqlx::Error)`, which
checks specifically for a Postgres unique-violation on a table's
auto-generated `<table>_pkey` constraint (as opposed to, say,
`users_email_key`, which no amount of retrying with a new id would ever
resolve). All four id-assigning inserts (`auth::register`,
`listings::create`, `demands::create`, `transactions::create`) now loop:
generate an id, attempt the insert, regenerate and retry on a PK collision,
propagate any other error immediately, and return a clean `500` (logged
server-side with detail, generic message to the client) if genuinely
exhausted after 5 attempts. `transactions::create`'s case is the trickiest,
since it holds an open DB transaction across two inserts (the transaction
row, then its first history event) -- a collision there drops the whole
`tx` (Postgres aborts a transaction after any failed statement in it, so
partial retry isn't possible) and starts a fresh one for the next attempt.

Verified empirically, not just by inspection: temporarily shrank the id
space to 3 possible values, then created listings against it. The first
three succeeded with three distinct ids (proving the retry loop actually
regenerates on collision), and a fourth attempt -- genuinely impossible,
no free ids left -- failed cleanly with `500 An internal error occurred.`
instead of hanging, crashing, or silently creating a duplicate; the server
log correctly recorded `failed to generate a unique listing id after 5
attempts` without leaking that detail to the client. Restored the real id
space afterward and re-ran an end-to-end check across all four entity
types. `cargo test` passes.

### 5. Input validation is inconsistent between near-identical fields — ✅ FIXED (2026-09-24)
- `pricePerUnit` on listings rejected negative values; `indicativeBudget` on
  demands did **not** — `-999999` was accepted with `200 OK`.
- Empty strings were accepted for `commodity`, `unit`, `qualityGrade`, and
  `location`/`destinationLocation` on both listings and demands (a listing
  with `commodity: ""` was created successfully).
- Email format was not validated on register — `"not-an-email"` was
  accepted as a valid email.

Fixed with a new shared `src/validation.rs` module (`require_non_empty`,
`is_valid_email`) instead of each handler inventing its own version of the
check:
- `demands::create` now rejects a negative `indicativeBudget`, matching
  `listings::create`'s existing `pricePerUnit` check.
- Both `listings::create` and `demands::create` now reject blank
  `commodity`, `unit`, `qualityGrade`, and `location`/`destinationLocation`.
- `auth::register` now rejects an email without an `@`, a non-empty local
  part, and a domain containing a `.` (deliberately permissive — not full
  RFC 5322 validation, just enough to catch obviously-invalid input).

Verified: all four previously-accepted invalid inputs now return `400`
with a clear message; valid listings, demands, and registrations are
unaffected. Two new unit tests for `is_valid_email` plus the existing
suite all pass (`cargo test`, 8 tests).

### 6. Error response shape is inconsistent — ✅ FIXED (2026-09-24)
Hand-written `AppError` responses returned `{"error": "..."}` with correct
status codes, but Axum's built-in request-rejection paths bypassed
`AppError` and returned **plain text** instead: malformed JSON body (`400`),
invalid enum variant (`422`), missing/wrong `Content-Type` (`415`).

Fixed with a new `AppJson<T>` extractor (`src/json_extractor.rs`) that
wraps `axum::Json<T>` and converts any `JsonRejection` into `AppError`
before it reaches the client — preserving the original status code
(`rejection.status()`) and message (`rejection.body_text()`), just now
wrapped in the same `{"error": "..."}` shape as every other response.
Every handler's request-body extractor (`Json<Body>` → `AppJson<Body>`)
was updated across `auth.rs`, `listings.rs`, `demands.rs`, and
`transactions.rs` — 8 usages in total. Response-side `Json<T>` (return
types) is untouched; only the request-extraction path changed.

Verified: malformed JSON, an invalid `role`/`status` enum value, and a
missing/wrong `Content-Type` header all now return `{"error": "..."}`
with their original status code unchanged. Valid requests and existing
hand-written errors (e.g. duplicate email → `409`) are unaffected.
`cargo test` passes.

## Recommended (not blocking, but standard practice before production)

| # | Finding | Why it matters |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | `CorsLayer::permissive()` allows any origin/method/header | Fine for local dev; must be locked to the real frontend origin(s) before any public deployment |
| 2 | No rate limiting on `/auth/login` or `/auth/register` | Unbounded brute-force / credential-stuffing surface |
| 3 | Password minimum is 6 characters | Below common baseline (8+); consider raising and/or adding complexity or breach-list checks |
| 4 | No `/health` endpoint | Most PaaS/orchestration platforms (including Railway) expect one for readiness checks |
| 5 | No pagination on `/listings`, `/demands`, `/transactions` | Fine at current scale; will need `limit`/`offset` or cursor pagination before real usage |
| 6 | No max length enforced on text fields | A 10,000-character `commodity` string was accepted without complaint |
| 7 | JWT is stateless with no revocation | Normal for JWT, but means there's no real "logout" — a leaked token stays valid until it expires (24h) |
| 8 | No API version prefix (`/api/v1/...`) | Not urgent pre-launch, but retrofitting versioning after clients exist is painful |

---

## Confirmed solid (no action needed)

Argon2 password hashing, parameterized queries (no SQL injection surface
anywhere tested), the transaction state machine's transition/actor
enforcement (the most-tested and most-correct part of the system), CORS
preflight handling, and consistent camelCase field naming matching the
frontend's type definitions apart from item 2 above.
